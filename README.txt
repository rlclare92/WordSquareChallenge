         * Initial Solution/ Steps
         * 1. First will need some input from the user in the console.
         * 2. Starting with what the maximum length should be for the grid.
         * 3. Then ask for a LIST of letters of their own choosing.
         * 4a. Sort the LIST to be in alphabetical order. (later added to my process to help with organising the letters and iterating over them)
         * 4b. Select a random letter from the users list.
         * 5. Call the txt file
         * 6. Search for a word that starts with the random letter
         * 7. Check it matches the maximumWordLength.
         * 8. Check the word contains letters from the users list.
         * 9.
         *
         * With the 1st lot of my steps I was struggling to clearly set out what I would need to do next with the users input.
         * And felt like I was overcomplicating it.
         *
         * 2nd solution idea
         * Separate the challenge into two main tasks.
         * 1. with the user input search for words that contain the letters given and have the maximum length.
         * 2. With the words provided create a word square of them.
