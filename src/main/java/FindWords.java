   /*
   * The aim of this class is to read the dictionary text file.
   * Use the user's input to loop through and get a sense of what values we have and a count of those.
   * Read through each line of the file, creating a similar count to the users letters
   * comparing the length of the valid words to what the user has set as the size of the square (the length of the word)
   * And sort the words that met our requirements into a new ArrayList, we can later use to loop over and set up our word square.
   *
   * Future Improvements
   *    - Call the dictionary url instead, rather than having the text file within the project, as it is a large file and take memory and slows performance.
   *    - Look at having the condition wordLength == currentWord.length() done towards the beginning of the for loop, to improve the response time.
   *    - Adding in some try/ catches to help guard against any errors that may rise and provide clear logs of the issue.
