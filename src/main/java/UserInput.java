/*
 *   Future Improvements
 *
 *    userNumberInput Method
 *   - Convert into a try catch to help with handling error exceptions and be more defence code.
 *   - Could look at if possible to use a smaller typecast and limit the number to help with memory consumption.
 *
 *    userLettersInput Method
 *   - Place conditional statement to prevent invalid special and numeric characters being used. i.e., numbers, *, !, ., Â£ and ect.
 *   - Add condition statement to ensure the is enough letters the user inputs to create the word square.
 *   - Look into how to set-up unit tests with the use of the scanner class.
